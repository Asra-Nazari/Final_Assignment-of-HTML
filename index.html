    <h4 style="text-align: center;"> SUSHI</h4>
    
    <p> 1.	Origins in China (2nd century BC):

        The concept of sushi began in China around the 2nd century BC as a method for preserving fish. Fish was salted and stored in rice, which allowed it to ferment and stay fresh for longer periods. This process was known as narezushi.
        
        In narezushi, the rice was discarded after fermentation, and only the fish was eaten. This early form of sushi was very different from the modern sushi we know today.
        
        
        2.	Introduction to Japan (8th century):
        
        Sushi made its way to Japan in the 8th century. The Japanese modified the technique, and over time, the rice began to be consumed along with the fish. This style, known as seiseizushi, was more similar to the sushi we recognize today.
        
        During the Edo period (17th to 19th century), a more refined and modern version of sushi began to develop in Japan.
        
        
        3.	Development of Modern Sushi (19th century):
        
        The sushi we know today, nigiri sushi, began to take shape in Tokyo (formerly Edo) during the early 19th century. A man named Hanaya Yohei is credited with creating nigiri sushi by serving small pieces of fresh fish on top of vinegared rice. This new style of sushi was easy to prepare and eat quickly, making it a popular street food in Japan.
        
        The use of fresh fish (Instead of fermented fish) and the combination of rice with vinegar helped give sushi its distinctive taste and texture.
        
        
        4.	Global Spread (20th century to present):
        
        Sushi became internationally popular after World War II when Japanese cuisine began to spread across the world. In the late 20th century, sushi bars and restaurants started to appear globally.
        
        The invention of California Roll in the 1960s, which uses avocado, cucumber, and cooked crab (instead of raw fish), played a significant role in popularizing sushi in Western countries. It made sushi more accessible to those unfamiliar with raw fish.
        
        
        Today, sushi is enjoyed worldwide in various forms, from traditional Japanese restaurants to fusion interpretations in different countries. It’s no longer just a Japanese dish; it’s a global culinary phenomenon.
