<h4> Kinds of SUSHI</h4>

<p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice, raw fish, and other ingredients
     like vegetables, shrimp, or egg. It is commonly served with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi.
</p>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            	Nigiri (握り寿司)
            A traditional sushi consisting of a slice of raw fish or seafood placed on top of a small ball 
            of vinegared rice. Sometimes garnished with a small amount of wasabi. </li>
        <li>	Maki (巻き寿司)
            Rolled sushi made by spreading vinegared rice on a sheet of nori (seaweed), adding fillings like fish, vegetables, or avocado, then rolling it up and slicing it into bite-sized pieces. </li>
        <li> Uramaki (裏巻き寿司)
            Similar to maki, but the rice is on the outside and the nori is on the inside, wrapping around the fillings. It’s often coated with sesame seeds or fish roe. </li>
           
            <li> Temaki (手巻き寿司)
                A cone-shaped hand roll made by wrapping nori around vinegared rice and fillings like fish, vegetables, and sometimes pickles. It’s meant to be eaten with hands.</li>
            <li> Sashimi (刺身)
                Thinly sliced raw fish or seafood, typically served without rice. It’s often served with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.  </li>
            <li> Chirashi (ちらし寿司)
                A “scattered sushi” bowl where vinegared rice is topped with an assortment of sliced raw fish, vegetables, and sometimes pickles. It’s a more casual way of enjoying sushi. </li>
            <li> 	Inari (稲荷寿司)
                Sushi rice wrapped in a pouch of sweet and savory fried tofu skin, typically served as a vegetarian option.</li>
            <li> 	Gunkan Maki (軍艦巻き寿司)
                “Battleship” sushi, where a strip of nori is wrapped around a ball of rice, and topped with ingredients like fish roe or sea urchin. It’s called “battleship” because of its shape. </li>
            <li> Ebi Nigiri (海老握り寿司)
                A variation of nigiri where shrimp (ebi) is placed on top of rice. Often garnished with a small piece of wasabi between the rice and the shrimp.   </li>
            <li>	Unagi Nigiri (うなぎ握り寿司)
                Grilled eel (unagi) served on top of vinegared rice, often glazed with a sweet soy-based sauce.</li>
